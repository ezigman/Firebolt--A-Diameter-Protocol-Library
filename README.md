Firebolt--A-Diameter-Protocol-Library
=====================================

A python library/tools repo for viewing/modifying/saving/sending diameter based network events.

It can be called as a framework since it provides you with API to parse and objectify AVP's. It can also be called as 
a command line tool, since it can view diameter packets (both simple and grouped), edit the packet, save them in a file 
and send them across network via socket.

Since I have done most of the implementation while I was working at Amdocs, most of the functionality provided may be very particular
to Amdocs. But, it should not stop anybody from adding extra features, as the Library code is written in a very
object oriented fashion and keeping extensibility in mind.

Ans also the testing was done mainly on Linux platform.

So, have a look around and enjoy !!


NOTE: Use as you may for good reasons. But, I do not gurantee anything about it.
